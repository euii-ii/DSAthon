# DSAthon - Data Structures & Algorithms Hackathon

## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to **DSAthon**, a hackathon focused on solving complex Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems efficiently using **TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**. This event is designed to challenge your problem-solving skills while fostering collaboration and learning.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed JavaScript for better maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **JavaScript** - Core language for algorithmic solutions and interactions.
